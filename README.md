#Predictive Text Generator (Python)

This project is a simple "Predictive Text Generator" built using Python.  
It learns patterns from a given training text file and predicts the next word based on user input.


 Features
- Reads and learns from any text file
- Builds a word-prediction model
- Predicts the next word using trained data
- Simple and beginner-friendly Python code
- Easy to customize with more training text

 Project Structure
 How It Works
1. Load training text from a `.txt` file  
2. Split the words and build a dictionary of word relationships  
3. Ask the user to enter a word  
4. Predict the next possible word using the model  


 How to Run the Program
1. Install Python 3  
2. Open the project folder in VS Code or terminal  
3. Run:
4.  When asked, enter a starting word  
5. The model will attempt to predict the next word  
 

 How to Add More Training Data
- Open `training_data.txt`
- Add any text you want (stories, articles, essays, paragraphs)
- Save the file  
- Run the program again — it will learn from the new text automatically

 Future Improvements 
- Add multiple-word predictions  
- Use NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy  
- Build a GUI  
- Deploy as a small web app  

 Contributing
You can contribute by improving the model or adding features.
